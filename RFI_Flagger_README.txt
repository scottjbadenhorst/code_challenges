RFI Flagger ReadME
==========================================
Author: Scott James Badenhorst

Compile: type "make"
Required Libs: Gnuplot

Run: ./RFI_Flagger -[Mode Parameter]


Mode Parameter:
USERMODE - Requires user to identify the RFI source in GNUplot and supply the position and magnitude of the source.
TESTMODE - Automatically supplies required parameters.


Function:
This program generates a 1D model dataset with Gaussian noise generated by the Box_Muller transformation.
A gaussian RFI source is injected into the data.

The RFI source is removed in two ways:
1) Perfect case: The Gaussian profile of the RFI source is known and is extracted perfectly.
This is included to compare the success of the alternat method.

2) Automated case: Only the maximum magnitude and position of the RFI source is known.
   A Gaussing is fitted by varying standard deviation in order to minimise the Root Mean Square Error.


Output:
Relevant RMSE values
Three plots:
- Noise data
- Perfectly removed RFI
- Automated removed RFI
